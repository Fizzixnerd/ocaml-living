# 0.2.0

* Make setter functions create dependencies with the values they set. (#1)
    (Matt Walker)

- Add tests for new setter functions. (#1)
    (Matt Walker)

# 0.3.0

* Add Living_core.Make functor
    (Matt Walker)

* Add Living_core_intf module
    (Matt Walker)

- Refactor Living_core
    (Matt Walker)

* Add module configuration
    (Matt Walker)

* Make dependencies a tree instead of a list (thanks @edwintorok for the idea!)
    (Matt Walker)

* Add `Default` module to both Living_core and Living_ctypes, containing 
  a default implementation of the functor, and remove that default implementation
  from being the modules themselves.  ie. You will need to change `open Living_core`
  to `open Living_core.Default` if you want the same behaviour as before, etc.
    (Matt Walker)

* Fix use-after-free errors in set functions by making dependencies mutable and adding
  to them during each `set`-like method.
